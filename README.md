# This site provide information about Fifa World Cup

Was created for one of mine classes, i didn't have to give even a half of work that i did, but i wanted to learn new stuff with this project so i added Skeleton-loading, also practised more use cases of prisma and tailwind.

I wasn't the only author of this site as it was made with Natalia K. who created frontpage bracket and logo.

## Tech Stack = Nuxt 3 + Prisma + Tailwind + Pinia

And few more used mainly for optimisation: image-edge, nuxt-compression. Or just to make my life easier while creating themes: color-mode.
